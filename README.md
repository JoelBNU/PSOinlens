# X-ray Lens Finder

A program with the particle swarm optimization algorithm for designing the mono-capillary X-ray lens

The 'X-ray Lens Finder.py' is the main PSO algorithm program to find best mono-capillary lens.

The 'MMN in lens.py' is a program of experimental control in the paper.

In this software packages, the 'MMN in lens.py' can be used alone to find target lens.

If you want to save run time cost, the 'X-ray Lens Finder.py' is a better choice.
