# X-ray Lens Finder

A program with the particle swarm optimization algorithm for designing the mono-capillary X-ray lens

The 'PSO X-ray Lens Finder.py' is the main PSO algorithm program to find best mono-capillary lens.

The 'MMN X-ray Lens Finder.py' is a program of experimental control in the paper.

In this software packages, the 'MMN X-ray Lens Finder.py' can be used alone to find target lens.

If you want to save run time cost, the 'PSO X-ray Lens Finder.py' is a better choice.
